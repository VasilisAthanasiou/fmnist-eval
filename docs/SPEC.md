# Fashion MNIST Classification using Tensorflow

## Specification Sheet
### Requirements
- Tensorflow
- [MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

### Goals
1. Train and Evaluate multiple Neural Nets that differ in:<br>- Number of hidden layers<br>- Number of perceptrons<br>- Training set size<br>- Gradient descent iterations
2. Evaluate the NNs using the following metrics:<br>- Classification accuracy<br>- Training time<br>- Inference time
3. Create a web app that will take input images return their class
